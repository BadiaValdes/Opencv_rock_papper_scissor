# Opencv_rock_papper_scissor
A rock papper scissor game created with OpenCV.

Hi this os our final project of human's gesture recognition. The project consists in a game of rock papper scissor. 

You will need to make some tweak to the code because we adapt it to our environment so in your case may be an error in the hand's contours. 

The lines that may be need changed are:

Method calculateFingers: the value of the number in d>40 which permits eliminate the incorrect angles detection. 

In the main code the value of the lower var. That's value correspond to the min color that the camera will catch, so in our case works fine, but you may have other condition in you room so, you need to change it. 

Thanks for read and that is all.
